        Censorship in George Orwell's *1984* and Its Modern Relevance
      </h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Censorship is a pervasive and complex issue that plays a central role in
        George Orwell’s *1984*. In the novel, the Party—led by the figurehead of
        Big Brother—employs censorship as a primary tool to control the populace
        and maintain its totalitarian regime. Orwell’s exploration of censorship
        in *1984* demonstrates how control over information, manipulation of
        language, and the suppression of dissent create an oppressive society.
        The novel's themes remain relevant today, as governments and
        institutions continue to wield similar tactics in the real world.

        <h3 class="content-title">1. Control of Information</h3>
        <ul class="content-items">
          <li>
            <strong>Ministry of Truth</strong>: The ministry’s name is deeply
            ironic, as its function is to constantly rewrite history and
            fabricate facts to align with the Party’s needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Newspeak</strong>: The Party introduces Newspeak, a language
            designed to eliminate words that could express dissenting ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unperson</strong>: Those who fall out of favor with the
            Party are erased not only from the present but also from history.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content-title">2. Psychological Manipulation</h3>
        <ul class="content-items">
          <li>
            <strong>Doublethink</strong>: The ability to hold two contradictory
            beliefs simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fear and Surveillance</strong>: The ever-present fear of
            surveillance reinforces self-censorship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cult of Personality</strong>: Big Brother is elevated to an
            almost god-like status, with loyalty demanded from all citizens.

        <ul class="content-items">

            <strong>The Past is Changeable</strong>: By constantly rewriting
            history, the Party can justify its present actions.

        <h3>Surveillance and Control of Information</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The government uses constant surveillance
          through "telescreens" and manipulates historical records via the
          Ministry of Truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Heavy surveillance via
          social media, phone calls, and internet activity. State-controlled
          media distorts information, like in North Korea, China, and Russia.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Cult of Personality</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> Big Brother is a symbol of ultimate power, and
          citizens worship him through omnipresent imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Leaders like Kim Jong-un or
          Vladimir Putin are portrayed as infallible figures with omnipresent
          imagery.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Language as a Tool of Control</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The Party uses Newspeak to limit the range of
          thought by eliminating words that express subversive ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Censorship of free speech
          and social media, with certain words or topics forbidden to suppress
          dissent, as seen in China.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Repression of Dissent</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The Thought Police suppress any subversive
          thoughts, torturing individuals to force loyalty to the Party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Opposition leaders,
          journalists, and activists are imprisoned or silenced. Examples
          include political arrests in Russia and China.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Manipulation of Truth</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The Party rewrites history to ensure their
          infallibility, with slogans like "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery,
          Ignorance is Strength."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Governments manipulate
          history and create narratives that fit their current agenda. Russia
          has altered textbooks and controlled history.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>State of Perpetual War</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> A constant state of war between superstates
          keeps the population in fear and justifies harsh control over
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Authoritarian regimes may
          create a sense of crisis or war, such as the "War on Terror," to
          justify expanded control.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Psychological Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The Party forces citizens to accept
          contradictory beliefs, using doublethink to control their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Propaganda and
          psychological manipulation are used to shape public perception,
          control information, and maintain loyalty to the regime.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-item">
        <h3>Loss of Individuality and Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1984:</strong> The Party seeks to eliminate individuality and
          freedom. Citizens live under strict government control.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Many authoritarian regimes
          restrict freedoms, including freedom of speech and movement, to
          maintain control over the population.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="comparison-item-social">
      <h3>Social Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1984:</strong> The society is divided into three main classes:
        the Inner Party, the Outer Party, and the Proles. The Inner Party holds
        all the power, the Outer Party enforces the rules, and the Proles are
        the working class, largely ignored but kept under control through
        distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> Similar social stratification
        exists in many authoritarian regimes, where a ruling elite (often a
        dictator or party leadership) controls power, while the general
        population may be kept in poverty or under strict surveillance. In some
        cases, there may be a "middle class" that serves the regime's interests,
        with most citizens living in subjugation, as seen in regimes like North
        Korea or Russia.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="comparison-item-individuality">
      <h3>Loss of Individuality</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1984:</strong> In the world of *1984*, individuality is actively
        suppressed by the Party. Citizens are denied personal freedom, and their
        thoughts are controlled through the use of the Thought Police and
        constant surveillance. The concept of independent thinking is a crime,
        as the Party enforces absolute conformity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Modern-Day Dictatorships:</strong> In modern authoritarian
        regimes, individuality is also restricted. While people may not be as
        completely surveilled as in *1984*, citizens who express dissenting
        opinions or act outside the norm are often punished. In some countries,
        social media and freedom of expression are heavily censored, and
        opposition is crushed to maintain uniformity and power.
