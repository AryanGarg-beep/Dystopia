        Censorship in George Orwell's *1984* and Its Modern Relevance
      </h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Censorship is a pervasive and complex issue that plays a central role in
        George Orwell’s *1984*. In the novel, the Party—led by the figurehead of
        Big Brother—employs censorship as a primary tool to control the populace
        and maintain its totalitarian regime. Orwell’s exploration of censorship
        in *1984* demonstrates how control over information, manipulation of
        language, and the suppression of dissent create an oppressive society.
        The novel's themes remain relevant today, as governments and
        institutions continue to wield similar tactics in the real world.

        <h3 class="content-title">1. Control of Information</h3>
        <ul class="content-items">
          <li>
            <strong>Ministry of Truth</strong>: The ministry’s name is deeply
            ironic, as its function is to constantly rewrite history and
            fabricate facts to align with the Party’s needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Newspeak</strong>: The Party introduces Newspeak, a language
            designed to eliminate words that could express dissenting ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unperson</strong>: Those who fall out of favor with the
            Party are erased not only from the present but also from history.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content-title">2. Psychological Manipulation</h3>
        <ul class="content-items">
          <li>
            <strong>Doublethink</strong>: The ability to hold two contradictory
            beliefs simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fear and Surveillance</strong>: The ever-present fear of
            surveillance reinforces self-censorship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cult of Personality</strong>: Big Brother is elevated to an
            almost god-like status, with loyalty demanded from all citizens.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content-title">3. Historical Revisionism</h3>
        <ul class="content-items">
          <li>
            <strong>The Past is Changeable</strong>: By constantly rewriting
            history, the Party can justify its present actions.
